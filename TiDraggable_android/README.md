## How to use the module
To create a draggable view, simple create it like so:

```
   var view = Draggable.createView({ _props });
```

Keep in mind that the draggable view has the draggable properties already build in; if nothing is specified, it will be draggable all over the screen.

## Draggable View Properties:

### These will make the view stop at their corresponding positions

* maxLeft: (int)
* minLeft: (int)
* maxTop: (int)
* minTop: (int)

### This will make the view stick to it's axis:

* axis: (String) "x" or "y"

### isDraggable ( bool ) { default: true }

* Wether the view can will be draggable

## Event Listeners

1. start: will fire on touch start
2. move: will fire on touch move
3. stop: will fire on touch end


## How to build the module from source
1. Open the ```.classpath``` file and modify the parameters
2. Do the same thing with the build.properties
3. Read the Android Module Development Guide found in Appcelerator's wiki
